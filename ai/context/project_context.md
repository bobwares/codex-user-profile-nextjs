- Detailed Description: The Customer Registration application provides a modern, responsive web interface for onboarding new customers into an organizationâ€™s system. It implements a multi-step registration wizard built with Next.js (Pages Router) that captures personal details, contact information, addresses, and preference settings. The data flow follows a clean separation of concerns with container and presentational components, and integrates API routes for secure data persistence. This application serves as the foundational entry point for managing customer profiles, enabling backend services to verify, store, and synchronize customer information across systems. The project adheres to best practices in accessibility, validation, and error handling, with built-in unit tests and consistent styling via Tailwind CSS.
