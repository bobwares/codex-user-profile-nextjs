# Architecture Decision Record

Adopt Next.js Scalable Pages Router Pattern

**Turn**: 1

**Status**: Proposed

**Date**: 2025-10-04 - 01:34

**Context**
The project requires a scalable Next.js application scaffold aligned with the Pages Router architecture and governance rules provided by the Agentic AI Pipeline.

**Options Considered**
- Use an App Router-based scaffold.
- Implement a minimal static site without structured layers.
- Follow the documented Next.js Scalable (Pages Router) pattern.

**Decision**
Follow the Next.js Scalable (Pages Router) pattern to ensure compatibility with the pipeline guidance, including container/presentational separation, services layer, state management, and comprehensive tooling.

**Result**
Project files, directories, and configuration will mirror the prescribed pattern, including services, tests, and governance artifacts.

**Consequences**
- Pros: Predictable structure, maintainability, ready for future automation.
- Cons: Higher upfront setup effort due to extensive scaffolding requirements.
